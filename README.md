# lua_cliargs

[![travis-ci status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/amireh/lua_cliargs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/amireh/lua_cliargs/builds)

cliargs is a command-line argument parser for Lua. It supports several types of arguments:

1. required arguments
2. optional arguments with different notations: `-short-key VALUE` and/or `--expanded-key=VALUE`
3. optional arguments with multiple-values that get appended to a list
4. optional "flag" arguments (on/off options) with notations: `-short-key` and/or `--expanded-key`
5. a single optional "splat" argument which can be repeated (must be the last argument)

Optional arguments can have default values (strings), flags always default to 'true'.

## Usage Examples

See the examples under the `examples/` directory.

## API

### `cli:argument(key: string, desc: string[, callback: fn])`

Defines a required argument.

Required arguments do not take a symbol like `-` or `--`, may not have a default value, and are parsed in the order they are defined.

For example:

```lua
cli:argument('INPUT', 'path to the input file')
cli:argument('OUTPUT', 'path to the output file')
```

At run-time, the arguments have to be specified using the following notation:

```bash
$ ./script.lua ./main.c ./a.out
```

If the user does not pass a value to _every_ argument, the parser will raise an error.

### `cli:option(key: string, desc: string[, default: *, callback: fn])`

Defines an optional argument.

Options can be specified in a number of ways on the command-line. As an example, let's assume we have a `compress` option that may be one of `gzip` (default,) `lzma`, or something else:

```lua
cli:option('-c, --compress=VALUE', 'compression algorithm to use', 'gzip')
```

At run-time, the option may be specified using any of the following notations:

```bash
$ ./script.lua -c lzma
$ ./script.lua -c=lzma
$ ./script.lua --compress lzma
$ ./script.lua --compress=lzma
$ ./script.lua --compress= # this overrides the default of `gzip` to `nil`
```

### `cli:flag(key: string, desc: string[, default: *, callback: fn])`

Defines an optional "flag" argument.

Flags are a special subset of options that can either be `true` or `false`. 

For example:

```lua
cli:flag('-q, --quiet', 'Suppress output.', true)
```

At run-time:

```bash
$ ./script.lua --quiet
$ ./script.lua -q
```

Passing a value to a flag raises an error:

```bash
$ ./script.lua --quiet=foo
$ echo $? # => 1
```

Flags may be _negatable_ by prepending `[no-]` to their key:

```lua
cli:flag('-c, --[no-]compress', 'whether to compress or not', true)
```

Now the user gets to pass `--no-compress` if they want to skip compression, or either specify `--compress` explicitly or leave it unspecified to use compression.

### `cli:splat(key: string, desc: string[, default: *, maxcount: number, callback: fn])`

Defines a "splat" (or catch-all) argument.

This is a special kind of argument that may be specified 0 or more times, the values being appended to a list.

For example, let's assume our program takes a single output file and works on multiple source files:

```lua
cli:argument('OUTPUT', 'path to the output file')
cli:splat('INPUTS', 'the sources to compile', nil, 10) -- up to 10 source files
```

At run-time, it could be invoked as such:

```bash
$ ./script.lua ./a.out file1.c file2.c main.c
```

If you want to make the output optional, you could do something like this:

```lua
cli:option('-o, --output=FILE', 'path to the output file', './a.out')
cli:splat('INPUTS', 'the sources to compile', nil, 10)
```

And now we may omit the output file path:

```bash
$ ./script.lua file1.c file2.c main.c
```

### `cli:parse(args: table) -> table`

Parses the arguments table. This is the primary routine. The return value is a table containing all the arguments, options, flags, and splat arguments that were specified or had a default (where applicable).

The table keys are the keys you used to define the arguments (both short and expanded notations like `-q` => `q` and `--quiet` => `quiet`).

Example:

```lua
local args
args = cli:parse() -- uses the global arguments table
args = cli:parse({ '--some-option', 'arg' })
```

**Accessing arguments**

All types of arguments must specify a *key*. In the case of required arguments, the keys are only used in the help listings. However, for optional arguments, they are mandatory (either *--key* or *--extended-key* must be specified, the other is optional).

The `cli:parse()`  method will parse the command line and return a table with results. Accessing argument or option values in this table can be done using the key with the leading dashes omitted (`-` or `--`). When defining an option (or a flag) , you can access it using either key or expanded-key; they'll both be defined.

See the examples for more on this.

### `cli:print_help() -> string`

Prints the help listing. This is automatically done if the user specifies `--help` as an argument at run-time.

An example is shown in the help-listing section below.

### `cli:print_usage() -> string`

Prints a subset of the full help-listing showing only the usage/invocation format. For example:

```
Usage: cli_example.lua [OPTIONS]  INPUT  [OUTPUT-1 [OUTPUT-2 [...]]]
```

### `cli:set_name(name: string)`

Allows you to specify a name for the program which will be used in the help listings and error messages.

### `cli:set_description(desc: string)`

Allows you to specify a short description of the program to display in the help listing.

### `cli:set_colsz(key_columns: number, desc_columns: number)`

Specifies the formatting options for the help listings.

The first argument is how wide, in characters, should the first column that contains the keys/names of the arguments be.

The second argument denotes how wide, in characters, should the second column that contains the argument descriptions be.

By default, these are set to `0` which means cliargs will auto-detect the best column sizes. The description column will be capped to a width of 72 characters.

## Help listings `--help`

A help listing will be automatically generated and accessed using the `--help` argument. You can also force its display in the code using `cli:print_help()`.

This is the result for our example (see `examples/00_general.lua`):

```
Usage: cli_example.lua [OPTIONS]  INPUT  [OUTPUT-1 [OUTPUT-2 [...]]]

ARGUMENTS:
  INPUT                 path to the input file (required)
  OUTPUT                multiple output paths (optional, default:
                        /dev/stdout)

OPTIONS:
  -c, --compress=FILTER the filter to use for compressing output: gzip,
                        lzma, bzip2, or none (default: gzip)
  -o FILE               path to output file (default: /dev/stdout)
  -d                    script will run in DEBUG mode
  -v, --version         prints the program's version and exits
  --verbose             the script output will be very verbose
```

## Validations

### Runtime argument validation

From a parsing point of view, there are 3 cases that need to be handled which are outlined below. If I missed something, please open a ticket!

**Missing a required argument**

```
$ lua examples/00_general.lua
cli_example.lua: error: bad number of arguments; 1-4 argument(s) must be specified, not 0; re-run with --help for usage.
```

**Missing value for an optional argument**

```
$ lua examples/00_general.lua --compress inputfile
cli_example.lua: error: option --compress requires a value to be set; re-run with --help for usage.
```

**Unknown arguments**

```
$ lua examples/00_general.lua -f inputfile
cli_example.lua: error: unknown/bad flag; -f; re-run with --help for usage.
```

### Some sanity guards

In the following cases, `cliargs` will report an error to you and terminate the running script:

1. flag options can not accept a value. For example: `cli:add_flag('-v VERSION')` will return an error
2. duplicate keys are not allowed: defining two options with the key `--input` will be rejected

## Tests

Running test specs is done using [busted](http://olivinelabs.com/busted/). You can install it using [LuaRocks](http://www.luarocks.org/), and then just call it with the `spec` folder:

```
luarocks install busted
cd /path/to/lua_cliargs/
busted spec
```

## Changelog

### Changes from 2.5.x 3.0

This major version release contains BREAKING API CHANGES. See the UPGRADE guide for help in updating your code to make use of it.

**More flexible parsing**

- options can occur anywhere now even after arguments (unless the `--` indicator is specified, then no options are parsed afterwards.) Previously, options were accepted only before arguments.
- options using the short-key notation can be specified using `=` as a value delimiter as well as a space (e.g. `-c=lzma` and `-c lzma`)
- the library is now more flexible with option definitions (notations like `-key VALUE` or `--key=VALUE`)
- `--help` or `-h` will now cause the help listing to be displayed no matter where they are (previously, it only happened if they were the first option)

**Re-defining defaults**

It is now possible to pass a table containing default values (and override any 
existing defaults).

The function for doing this is called `cli:load_defaults().`.

This makes it possible to load run-time defaults from a configuration file, for example.

**Other changes**

- a new hook was introduced for installing a custom parse error handler: `cli:set_error_handler(fn: function)`. The default will invoke `error()`.
- internal code changes and more comprehensive test-coverage

### Changes from 2.5.1 to 2.5.2

- No longer tracking the (legacy) tarballs in git or the luarocks package. Instead, we use the GitHub release tarballs for each version.

### Changes in 2.4.0 from 2.3-4

1. All arguments now accept a callback that will be invoked when parsing of those arguments was successful
2. (**POSSIBLY BREAKING**) Default value for flags is now `nil` instead of `false`. This will only affect existing behavior if you were explicitly testing unset flags to equal `false` (i.e. `if flag == false then`) as opposed to `if flag then` (or `if not flag then`).
3. Minor bugfixes

### Changes in 2.3.0

1. the parser will now understand `--` to denote the end of optional arguments and will map whatever comes after it to required/splat args
2. `-short VALUE` is now properly supported, so is `-short=VALUE`
3. short-key options can now officially be composed of more than 1 character
4. the parser now accepts callbacks that will be invoked as soon as options are parsed so that you can bail out of parsing preemptively (like for `--version` or `--help` options)
5. options can now accept multiple values via multiple invocations if a table was provided as a default value (passed-in values will be appended to that list)

### Changes in 2.2-0 from 2.1-2

1. the `=` that separates keys from values in the `--expanded-key` notation is no longer mandatory; using either a space or a `=` will map the value to the key (e.g., `--compress lzma` is equal to `--compress=lzma`)

### Changes in 2.0.0 from 1.x.x

1. added the 'splat' argument, an optional repetitive argument for which a maximum number of occurrences can be set
1. removed the reference, arguments are now solely returned by their key/expanded-key (BREAKING!)
1. removed object overhead and the `new()` method as the library will only be used once on program start-up (BREAKING!)
1. after parsing completed successfully, the library will effectively delete itself to free resources (BREAKING!)
1. option/flag is now allowed with only an expanded-key defined
1. Debug aid implemented; adding a first option `--__DUMP__`, will dump the results of parsing the command line. Especially for testing how to use the commandline with arguments containing spaces either quoted or not.
1. the `print_usage()` and `print_help()` now have a 'noprint' parameter that will not print the message, but return it as an error string (`nil + errmsg`)
